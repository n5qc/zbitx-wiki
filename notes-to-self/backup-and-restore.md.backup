# Backup and Restore: zbitx-wiki Development Environment

This guide describes how to create and restore a backup of the full
development environment for the zBITX-Wiki, including all content,
configuration, and Git history.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Daily Working Backup Instructions

###  Whats Included:

- Project files (Markdown, config, assets, etc.)
- `.git` directory with full Git history and local branches
- Python virtual environment (optional)
- Local-only notes and untracked files

###  When to Back Up:

- After major changes or successful GitHub Pages deployments
- Before system upgrades or Raspberry Pi changes
- Periodically, as insurance against SD card failure

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Step-by-Step Daily Working Snapshot Backup (from home directory)

Move to your home directory (or parent of zBITX-Wiki)

**cd \~**

# Create a compressed archive with today's date

**  tar -czf zbitx-wiki-full-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz zBITX-Wiki/  **

# Keep rolling copies in Large Files on N5QC One Drive / HP Desktop

- 3 Copies

  1.  Backup on Raspberry Pi Home

  2.  Copy on HP Laptop ðŸ¡ª MyBook External

  3.  Copy on OneDrive Cloud

- 2 Different Media

  1.  Raspberry Pi uSD Card

  2.  MyBook External (Spinning Magnetic Disk)

  3.  OneDrive Cloud -- Who knows the media, redundant cloud data
      centers

- 1 -- At Least -- Offsite

  1.  OneDrive Cloud

  2.  Published Stuff on GitHub

## Monthly and Significant Milestone System Image Instructions

###  Whats Included:

- Full Raspberry Pi Development System

### When to Back Up:

- At Least Monthly while actively working
- After major changes or successful GitHub Pages deployments
- Before system upgrades or Raspberry Pi changes
- Periodically, as insurance against SD card failure

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Step-by-Step System Image

Close all files and apps

Use Raspberry Pi Imager to make a backup image on a separate Micro SD
Card

Make a compressed image of the backup card that can be stored in
multiple places.

**Raspberry Pi SD Shrink + Image Checklist** 

 

Make sure gparted is installed:

sudo apt update

sudo apt install gparted 

Run gparted to shrink the partition (is this necessary?)

sudo gparted

Right click on the lock icon to unlock the ext4 partition -- Probably
sdb2

Shrink the partition as much as possible.

There is a step in the process to zero out free space but I think
Raspberry Pi shrinker does that so skipping for now.

Make the image:

sudo dd if=/dev/sdb of=2025_05_27_zBITX-Wiki_MVP_2.img bs=4M
status=progress 

sudo dd if=/dev/sdb of=2025_05_31_zbitx-wiki.img bs=4M status=progress

> yyyy_mm_dd_zbitx-wiki.img

 \
sync

Shrink & make the image auto-expand (recommended) \
Install PiShrink: 

wget
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Drewsif/PiShrink/master/pishrink.sh

chmod +x pishrink.sh

sudo mv pishrink.sh /usr/local/bin

 

Run pishrink:

sudo pishrink.sh 2025_05_31_zbitx-wiki.img

> yyyy_mm_dd_zbitx-wiki.img

 

Compress the image:

xz -9 2025_05_31_zbitx-wiki.img

> yyyy_mm_dd_zbitx-wiki.img

 

1.  â†’ You now have raspberrypi.img.xz 

2.  Save the image in Large Files Repository and MyBook External 

3.  Restore the image with Raspberry Pi Imager or flash:

> xzcat raspberrypi.img.xz \| sudo dd of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress
