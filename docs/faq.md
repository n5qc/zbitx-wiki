#Project Background

## Q: Why did I do this?

A: I decided that I was going to research the zBITX while I was waiting for
my order to deliver. I started making notes and compiling reading
material, it dawned on me that it MIGHT be useful to share this info

## Q: Why did I select a GitHub hosted Wiki?

A: I decided that publishing a Wiki via GitHub would be a good learning
experience I chose to do the key work locally on a Raspberry Pi for that
experience and practice.

## Q: Is this the best way to do it?

A: Not necessarily. In fact probably only based on my personal learning
goals.

## Q: Is this a learning experience for me?

A: Yes, that's the goal.

## Q: Am I willing to share my learning experiences?

A: Yes, that's why I'm publishing.

## Q: Am I trying to compete with Groups dot IO?

A: No with the Creative Commons license that I put on this it will already
be able to be moved to places including Groups dot io with attribution
and as I get further down the road,

## Q: Is this intended to be a LONG TERM project?

A: No, both this documentation and also collaborative development are just
getting up to speed and changes are to be expected. Unless this becomes
THE definitive core documentation project (not my prediction) I will
probably stop maintaining this site and try to transition it to some
place that has more longevity. An example of this is Toshen's work on
digital voice where he did a lot of good work that is still recognized
as THE good overview. However, Toshen has stopped maintaining the work,
but has left the PDFs out there for people to read.
