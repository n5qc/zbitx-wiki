I decided that I was going to research the Z bit X and started making notes.  Looked like it would be useful to share them, so I decided to put them in the wiki.  Looking forward to what things I might want to do, I decided that publishing a site via GitHub would be a good learning experience, so I chose to do that on the Raspberry Pi. </p> <p>Is this the best way to do it?  Not necessarily. </p> <p>Is this a learning experience for me?  Yes, that's the goal. </p> <p>Am I willing to share my learning experiences?  Yes, that's why I'm publishing. </p> <p>Am I trying to compete with Groups dot IO?  No with the Creative Commons license that I put on this it will already be able to be moved on to places including Groups dot io with attribution and as I get further down the road, I will probably stop maintaining this site and try to transition it to some place that has more longevity.  An example. For model is Toshen's work on digital voice where he did a lot of good work that is still recognized as THE good overview and he has stopped maintaining it but has left the PDF out there for people to read. Probably PDF's that can't be edited and aren't the best bet, but trying to get things over to a site is anyway just some rambling thoughts that need to get put into the FAQ's and etcetera, etcetera.</p> <p>==============================================</p> <p>From One Note</p> <pre><code>\u2022 Working Collecting Point \u2014 Stays on Pi Git\n\u2022 Traveling Collecting Point \u2014 Back and Forth to Laptop\n\u2022 Daily Workflow\n    \u25cb Start Pi\n    \u25cb Activate virtual environment \n    \u25cb Pull\n    \u25cb Sftp files including traveling collecting point\n    \u25cb Close working collecting point to active collecting point\n    \u25cb Close active collecting point to backlog \n    \u25cb Work\n    \u25cb Update change log\n    \u25cb Commit &amp; Build\n    \u25cb Push &amp; Test\n    \u25cb Adjust traveling collecting point as needed\n    \u25cb Copy traveling collecting point to laptop\n    \u25cb Deactivate \n    \u25cb Backup \n    \u25cb Copy backup to large files\n\u2022 Backup Workflow\n    \u25cb Backup git in daily\n    \u25cb Image &amp; Rotate cards\n    \u25cb Upload Compressed images\n\u2022 Branching Plan\n    \u25cb Main\n    \u25cb Gh-pages\n    \u25cb Dev or editing\n    \u25cb Contrib \n    \u25cb Safety &amp; authority \n        \u00a7 only me or designate can update man and build / publish\n        \u00a7 Dev = TBD \u2014 I am thinking limited access scratch pad\n</code></pre> <p>Contrib = place for contributors (or do they just make their own branch and pull requests </p> <p>Do Backlog grooming.</p> <p>Change log.</p> <p>And once this is done, go ahead and do a literature search and start compiling note.
